How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It specified lines that changed and narrowed the search

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It saves time when debugging and allows you to start over from any previous point

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

The judgment relies on human liability and may not be efficient, but it's more flexible

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

It's more convenient and logical if the files are related to each other like in web dev

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

You can use them to view the past commits and also compare the changes between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

It allows you to take risks because you can always go back to a previous version and fix anything

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

Taking on group projects or doing a larger project
